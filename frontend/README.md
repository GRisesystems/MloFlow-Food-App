Welcome to the frontend section of Mloflow, an app built using Vite and React! This repository contains the client-side code for Mloflow, where users can interact with the application's intuitive and efficient interface.

## Dependencies Installation

Before running the frontend section, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

This will install all the required packages and modules specified in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Frontend Section

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend section of Mloflow using the following command:
